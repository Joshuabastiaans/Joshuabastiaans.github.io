          <p class="bio">
            Hi, I'm Joshua. I am a creative game designer with a passion for
            crafting unique and immersive experiences. Just like other media,
            games take people outside of their daily lives to escape and
            connect. My goal is to create games that make you connect and feel
            what it’s like to be someone else, somewhere else. As a
            second-year Game Design student at HKU, I'm excited to continue
            pushing the boundaries of game design and create experiences that
            resonate deeply with players.

          <div id="answer1" class="answer hidden">
            My entire life has been a source of inspiration for my creations.
            The music I listen to, the movies I watch, and the games I play
            all significantly influence the games I develop today. When it
            comes to inspiring my team with a concept, I enjoy creating a
            simple soundtrack that captures the vibe of the idea. Music
            conveys emotions and nuances that words often can't describe, and
            it helps align everyone's perception of the concept, ensuring
            we're all on the same page.

            Why do I choose to have many different disciplines?
          </button>
          <div id="answer2" class="answer hidden">
            I also play the drums, and I’ve learned that creating
            good-sounding drums requires understanding of the entire
            composition. I believe that the same goes for games. To create
            effective levels, puzzles or mechanics that suit the game I have
            to understand the other disciplines that go into the development
            process of the game. By familiarizing myself with various aspects
            of the process, I can create more cohesive and engaging
            experiences.

      <h2>Experience Design</h2>
      <div class="sub-overlay-game">
        <p>Isn’t the whole point of making games designing an experience? Well in my "experience," it is often one of
          the most overlooked areas of design. These are the projects where I focused on creating a new and unique
          experience.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
              <p>It’s no lie that gaming isn’t the most physically healthy activity to do. Project Hybrid is a game that
                combines the physical interaction in the real world with the digital world. We made this game with the
                intention to get people motivated to move by the horror elements of the game. That's why we combined a
                dance mat with an arcade style horror game. The goal is to escape the haunted arcade hall by moving on
                the dance mat to the beat of the music.</p>
              <h4>Role</h4>
              <p>In this project I had the role of an audio/game designer. This allowed me to focus on matching the
                mechanics together with the sound feedback. For a game based on rhythmic input this was a vital part of
                making sure the player got the best experience.</p>

              <p>What if you could escape the normal consciousness via games? Well, that's how we started this project.
                Sure, we could drug our players before playing a game but it wouldn’t really be legal (and also maybe
                not so ethically responsible). That's why we went on a journey to create our own psychedelic experience
                without the need of any drug.</p>
              <h4>Role</h4>
              <p>Together with Lucas, a game designer, we designed and made the whole project. I focused on creating
                puzzles that represented challenges or thoughts that could occur in a psychedelic trip. I was also
                responsible for the sound design in this game, making sure you really get immersed in the experience.

      <h2>Puzzle Design</h2>
      <div class="sub-overlay-game">
        <p>Of all the mechanics in a game, puzzles are the most fun and interesting to design. You have to step beyond
          the actual puzzle itself to make it interesting and immersive. Here are the games I designed the puzzles for:

                Farmer Harold! Get ready to harness the magic of plants and break free from the enchanted garden. With
                his trusty bouquet of special flowers, farmer Harold will embark on a journey full of puzzles and
                excitement. Use the power of your blooms to send the perfect signals and make the right connections.
                Every flower has a unique impact on both the surroundings and other flowers. Get ready to become the

              <h4>Role</h4>
              <p>During the jam I mainly focused on creating interesting plants and puzzles. With a puzzle there are
                often 2 parts, the mechanics and level design. These 2 components together are what makes a puzzle
                interesting and fun.</p>

      <h2>Audio Design</h2>
      <div class="sub-overlay-game">
        <p>When making games, there are two major feedback systems for the player: vision and sound. Audio is one of the
          key factors in creating an immersive experience. It sets the mood, enhances the atmosphere, and provides
          critical cues to the player. Here are all the projects I designed the sound for.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
              <p>What if you could only hear? What challenges would there be in designing a game that just consists of
                sound? We made a game where you need to rescue a child in the dark forest, a place that’s known for one
                thing, the monster that roams the forest. This monster reacts to sound, so every sound you make, the
                monster knows where you are. As soon as you put on the VR headset you are in a different world, sucked
                into a world where suddenly a monster is standing next to you and you are super quiet and must save the
                child.</p>
              <h4>My role</h4>
              <p>How does the player feel, why does the player feel like that and how can we give the player a different
                feeling? These were questions that I dealt with during this project. One of the ways I got answers to
                these questions was the playtest.</p>

              <p>Games are usually played with a controller or a keyboard and mouse. In this project, I wanted to
                challenge myself by finding a way to break the conventional methods of playing a game while still making
                it fun and entertaining. That's when I started experimenting with an Arduino, a speaker, and a joystick,
                leading to the creation of “Find the Sound.” As you may have guessed from the name, the goal is to find
                the sound using the joystick before time runs out and you lose everything. You need to gather 4 points
                to win the game, and it gets harder as you progress.</p>

              <p>Het doel van mijn project was om mensen gitaar te laten spelen, beïnvloed door procedureel gegenereerde

                ideeën te komen. Ook kan de gebruiker zelf de “trippyness” van het geluid en visuals besturen.</p>

              <p>With the rapid development and powerful features of Blender, I am pushing for its integration into the
                Visualization Team at Heerema. Coming from 3DS Max, where we had an extensive library of custom scripts
                and add-ons, I am transferring the functionality of those add-ons into Blender to make the transition as
                seamless as possible. Blender is significantly faster and more responsive compared to 3DS Max, which is
                why it's crucial to adapt the functionality and UI of these add-ons to suit the software and workflow.
