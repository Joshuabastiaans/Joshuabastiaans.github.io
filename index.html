          <h1>WHO I AM</h1>
          <p class="bio">
            Hi, I'm Joshua. I am a creative game designer with a passion for
            crafting unique and immersive experiences. Just like other media,
            games take people outside of their daily lives to escape and
            connect. My goal is to create games that make you connect and feel
            what it’s like to be someone else, somewhere else. As a
            second-year Game Design student at HKU, I'm excited to continue
            pushing the boundaries of game design and create experiences that
            resonate deeply with players.

            What inspires my creativity in game design?
          </button>
          <div id="answer1" class="answer hidden">
            My entire life has been a source of inspiration for my creations.
            The music I listen to, the movies I watch, and the games I play
            all significantly influence the games I develop today. When it
            comes to inspiring my team with a concept, I enjoy creating a
            simple soundtrack that captures the vibe of the idea. Music
            conveys emotions and nuances that words often can't describe, and
            it helps align everyone's perception of the concept, ensuring
            we're all on the same page.

          <button class="question-button" data-answer="answer2">
            Why do I choose to have many different disciplines?
          </button>
          <div id="answer2" class="answer hidden">
            I also play the drums, and I’ve learned that creating
            good-sounding drums requires understanding of the entire
            composition. I believe that the same goes for games. To create
            effective levels, puzzles or mechanics that suit the game I have
            to understand the other disciplines that go into the development
            process of the game. By familiarizing myself with various aspects
            of the process, I can create more cohesive and engaging
            experiences.

                It’s no lie that gaming isn’t the most physically healthy activity to do. Project Hybrid is a game that
                combines the physical interaction in the real world with the digital world. We made this game with the
                intention to get people motivated to move by the horror elements of the game. That's why we combined a
                dance mat with an arcade style horror game. The goal is to escape the haunted arcade hall by moving on
                the dance mat to the beat of the music.

                making sure the player got the best experience.

                What if you could escape the normal consciousness via games? Well, that's how we started this project.
                Sure, we could drug our players before playing a game but it wouldn’t really be legal (and also maybe
                not so ethically responsible). That's why we went on a journey to create our own psychedelic experience
                without the need of any drug.

              <h4>Role</h4>
              <p>Together with Lucas, a game designer, we designed and made the whole project. I focused on creating
                puzzles that represented challenges or thoughts that could occur in a psychedelic trip. I was also
                responsible for the sound design in this game, making sure you really get immersed in the experience.
